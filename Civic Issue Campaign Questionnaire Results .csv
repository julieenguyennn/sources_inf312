E.g. Industrial Wind Turbines (not actually environmentally or economically feasible). Small towns are having to pay for their own lawyers to try to fight the development. Then their own taxes are used by the government to get TEAMS of lawyers to fight them. It's ridiculous.,"How much money government employees are taking in benefits. It's ridiculous when I hear that a young lawyers is getting 95% of their ridiculously high pay to stay at home on maternity leave when many women have no maternity leave. How much they get for eye glasses, etc. It's ridiculous to hear government employees complain about their benefits when it's paid for by their neighbours taxes and when those same neighbours probably have way less benefits.","Data on how productive government employees are. It's RIDICULOUS the number of lazy, useless people who don't lose their jobs because their protected. How much time and money does that waste? Along those lines, it would be great to calculate if, for example, all nurses reduced their pay by 2%, how many more nurses could we hire?",,"City (i.e. reports, Government studies)",,"Media(i.e. newspaper article, blog post, tv/radio interview)",,"Research(i.e. academic, projects, post grad, thesis)",,"City (i.e. reports, Government studies)",,"Media(i.e. newspaper article, blog post, tv/radio interview)",,"Research(i.e. academic, projects, post grad, thesis)",,"City (i.e. reports, Government studies)",,"Media(i.e. newspaper article, blog post, tv/radio interview)",,"Research(i.e. academic, projects, post grad, thesis)","Actual unbiased reports need to be put together regarding supposedly 'green' infrastructure. If I've said it once, I've said it a million times, green initiatives done on an industrial scale are no longer green. Industrial wind turbines do not make economic or environmental sense. Clear cutting forest for swaths of solar panels does not make sense. The evidence is pretty clear and building on this. There are smart ways to do it, and it's not being done. When the actual environmental experts say no and the government lawyers argue it... lawyers are basically useless, expensive guard dogs that have no knowledge and only defend without knowing what is actually right or wrong.","To begin, the government actually owns the first few feet of basically everyone's lawns in the city. Why does the city not mandate that everyone has to have a tree on their property. The city could plant a diversity of native trees. This would greatly impact heating and cooling, air quality, etc. If people didn't want to have a tree, it would be up to them to give reasons why they shouldn't have to have one.","As am important note, no one politically wants to say it but the truth is the number one thing we could do for the planet is decrease our population.
